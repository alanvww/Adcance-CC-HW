# Week 12: Conway's Game of Life in 3D

## What is Conway's Game of Life?

[The Game of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway's_Game_of_Life) is a cellular automaton and also a zero-player game, which will evolve by determent the initial state and providing complex visuals with a simple interaction.

## Why and why in 3D?

I chose this one as my final theme because when I was first studying programming, especially creative coding, Game of Life was one of my favorite visual projects for not only watching but also being able to express the beauty of codes in just seconds. It can be so clean and straightforward, like the image below. Mostly, they are 2d and displayed on the HTML canvas. However, based on the advantage of three.js and my week 10 homework, I can see the possibility of creating a 3d version of Game of Life.

## Technical Details

1. Three.js
2. TypeScript
3. Arduino

## Features

1. 3D displaying of Game of Life
2. Movable camera
3. Arduino button for random location start and pointer for start at specific location
4. potentiometers for speed of animation and Zoom in/out
5. Color modes for different themes(dat.gui)

## Difficulty

For now, the main difficulty and limitation to me will be the time we have. it is not much time left, and this project will almost cover everything we learned this semester. So my decision will mainly focus on the functionality of the display components. If the time is enough, I will try my best to add the controls and Arduino features to this project.

## Timeline

Week 4.18: Focus on completing and polishing the display components of the project without any controls(I will try my best to get some progress by office hours so that I can ask questions.)
Week 4.24: Debugging and keep improving the display components if not done yet last week, and add controls if possible.
