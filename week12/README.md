# Week 12: Conway's Game of Life in 3D

## What is Conway's Game of Life?

[The Game of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway's_Game_of_Life) is a cellular automaton and also a zero-player game, which will evolve by determent the initial state and providing complex visuals with a simple interaction.

## Why and why in 3D?

I chose this one as my final theme because when I was first studying programming, especially creative coding, Game of Life was one of my favorite visual projects for not only watching but also being able to express the beauty of codes in just seconds. It can be so clean and straightforward, like the image below. Mostly, they are 2d and displayed on the HTML canvas. However, based on the advantage of three.js and my week 10 homework, I can see the possibility of creating a 3d version of Game of Life.
